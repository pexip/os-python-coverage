Description: code coverage tool for Python 2
 The ‘coverage’ library measures which parts (statements) of a Python
 program are executed while it is run. This is useful for testing:
 those parts of a program that are not executed by the tests have not
 been tested.
 .
 This package contains the Python version 2 ‘coverage’ library, and the
 ‘python-coverage’ program to perform and report coverage tests.
